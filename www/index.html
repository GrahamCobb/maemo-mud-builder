<h1>mud-builder</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">Maemo Unofficial Debs</h2>

<p>MUD is "Maemo Unofficial Debs". It's an autobuilder to make it bring together
simple source ports, and to ensure they're available in a single repository.</p>

<p>It was inspired by conversations on <a href="http://maemo.org/pipermail/maemo-developers/2006-July/004527.html">maemo-developers</a>
and at <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2340">Internet Tablet Talk</a>.
</p>

<p>For example, <code>privoxy</code>, <code>netcat</code>, <code>vim</code>,
<code>rsync</code> etc. are all candidates for MUD. The
idea is that small scripts/configuration files will describe how to build
Maemo-specific ARMEL debs which are run on developer's machines. This will
result in one or many debs which can then be deployed on
<a href="http://maemo.org/maemowiki/ExtrasRepository">repository.maemo.org/extras</a>. This means that each individual developer
scratching an itch for a port will not have to find a repo to host it, and
projects with little or no changes for Maemo from the upstream source will not
have to apply for a Garage project: a patch will be provided to MUD and the
resulting deb deployed to the contrib repository during the next run.</p>

<p>The source code to the autobuilder is under the Artistic Licence, but the
resulting debs will be under the licence of the original project.</p>

<h2>Example workflow</h2>
<ol>
<li>User wants (say) <a href="">nmap</a> on his 770, but notes no-one has yet
   ported it to the 770 or armel. Even if there was an armel deb
   available, chances are it wouldn't be in a Maemo repo or the
   deb configured for the Application Manager.</li>

<li>User downloads/installs mud to his scratchbox and adds the
   necessary configuration to build <code>nmap</code>. Ideally, this would take
   no more than a single file containing a single line, but obviously
   more options are available.</li>

<li>User runs <code>mud build nmap</code> (or similar) and gets an Application
   Manager-compatible, armel deb ready for uploading to the extras
   repo. User notices, however, that he doesn't have a Garage account
   and doesn't think it worthwhile to create one for this one deb.</li>

<li>User submits patch to the mud project, where the patch is reviewed
   and, potentially included. Next time the mud admins run
   <code>mud -a build</code>, an additional nmap deb is produced. This is
   then uploaded to the contrib repo by the mud admins.</li>

<li>Other users refresh their packages and now see that nmap is
   ported.</li>

<li>As the upstream nmap is updated, so too is the mud package
   available through the contrib repo.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting started</h2>
<p>In lieu of proper documentation (which is forthcoming), here's a quick start guide:</p>

<ol>
<li>Check out <a
href="https://garage.maemo.org/scm/?group_id=63">mud-builder/trunk</a> from
Subversion into a directory under your Scratchbox home. <span class="note">This
can be done from within Scratchbox, which might be easiest, or externally if
necessary.</span></li>

<li>In Scratchbox, change to the mud-builder directory and type:

<pre><code>alias mud=$(pwd)/mud</code></pre>

<span class="note">This allows you to type <code>mud</code> to invoke the system, without having to add it to your path.</span></li>

<li>Switch to your SDK_ARMEL target:

<pre><code>sbox-config -st SDK_ARMEL</code></pre>

<span class="note">Your device architecture target may be named differently. Substitute the correct name for <code>SDK_ARMEL</code> in this case.</span></li>

<li>Build the existing <code>netcat</code> package:

<pre><code>mud build netcat</code></pre></li>

<li>Copy the resulting <code>upload/netcat-&#8230;.deb</code> to your Maemo
device and install with the Application Manager.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="creating">Creating a new package</h2>
<p>Currently best supported are simple command line utilities without many
build dependencies. For the sake of this example we'll duplicate the existing
<code>cmatrix</code> package. It is assumed that the previous tutorial has been folowed and that mud is installed and the alias set.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a file, <code>packages/mycmatrix.xml</code>:

<pre><code>&lt;package&gt;
    &lt;fetch type=&quot;debian&quot;&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;cmatrix&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;/fetch&gt;
&lt;/package&gt;</code></pre>
</li>

<li>TBC: In the mean time, there's a rough outline in <a
href="https://garage.maemo.org/plugins/scmsvn/viewcvs.php?root=mud-builder&amp;view=rev&amp;rev=16">r16's
commit message</a>.</li> </ol>
