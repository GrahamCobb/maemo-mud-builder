MUD is "Maemo Unofficial Debs". It's an autobuilder to make it bring together
simple source ports, and to ensure they're available in a single repository.

More details can be found here:

For example, privoxy, netcat, vim, rsync etc. are all candidates for MUD. The
idea is that small scripts/configuration files will describe how to build
Maemo-specific ARMEL debs which are run on developer's machines. This will
result in one or many debs which can then be deployed on
repository.maemo.org/contrib. This means that each individual developer
scratching an itch for a port will not have to find a repo to host it, and
projects with little or no changes for Maemo from the upstream source will not
have to apply for a Garage project: a patch will be provided to MUD and the
resulting deb deployed to the contrib repository during the next run.

The source code to the autobuilder will be under the Artistic Licence, but the
resulting debs will be under the licence of the original project.

The workflow would go something like this:

 * User wants (say) `nmap' on his 770, but notes no-one has yet
   ported it to the 770 or armel. Even if there was an armel deb
   available, chances are it wouldn't be in a Maemo repo or the
   deb configured for the Application Manager.

 * User downloads/installs mud to his scratchbox and adds the
   necessary configuration to build `nmap'. Ideally, this would take
   no more than a single file containing a single line, but obviously
   more options would be available.

 * User runs `mud build nmap' (or similar) and gets an Application
   Manager-compatible, armel deb ready for uploading to the contrib
   repo. User notices, however, that he doesn't have a Garage account
   and doesn't think it worthwhile to create one for this one deb.

 * User submits patch to the mud project, where the patch is reviewed
   and, potentially included. Next time the mud admins run
   `mud -a build', an additional nmap deb is produced. This is
   then uploadeded to the contrib repo by the mud admins.

 * Other users refresh their packages and now see that nmap is
   ported.

 * As the upstream nmap is updated, so too is the mud package
   available through the contrib repo.
