      <description>wxWidgets gives you a single, easy-to-use API for writing GUI applications on multiple platforms\nwxWidgets lets developers create applications for Win32, Mac OS X, GTK+, X11, Motif, WinCE, and more  using one codebase. It can be used from languages such as C++, Python, Perl, and C#/.NET. Unlike other cross-platform toolkits, wxWidgets applications look and feel native. This is because wxWidgets uses the platform's own native controls rather than emulating them. It's also extensive, free, open-source, and mature. Why not give it a try, like many others have?</description>
